## Introduction

One of the most popular tools for writing and formatting scientific papers is LaTeX - an extension of the TeX typesetting system. LaTeX makes it easy to format scientific documents, by deciding on many aspects of the format, style, and layout itself. LaTeX can also elegantly typeset mathematics, which is essential for a number of fields of study.

However, LaTeX has a number of issues. As a syntax, it has a number of inconsistencies that make it unpredictable, which gives it a steep learning curve. And while the style and format that LaTeX uses by default is good for certain types of document, for others it isn't, and the workarounds for this are lengthy and clumsy.

XSDR is intended to be an alternative to LaTeX as a document layout and formatting syntax. It is an XML specification. It uses very clear, regular, predictable syntax to describe the contents of a printable, paged document. It has a number of superficial similarities to HTML.

This repository just holds the specification for XSDR - it does not contain an XSDR compiler.
